# Bottoms-Up 
This repository is dedicated to the Cost Action of "Biodiversity Of Temperate forest Taxa Orienting Management Sustainability by Unifying Perspectives (BOTTOMS-UP) https://www.bottoms-up.eu/en/. Here there are some scripts used in shared analysis and research activities between the project and the author of the repository.


This codes are part of a short term scientific mission carried up by the PhD candidate Marco Baldo and his research lab Global Change Research Group at the Czech University of Life Sciences in collaboration with the Bottoms-Up COST Action coordinator Prof. Sabina Burrascano and her research group at the Department of Environmental Biology of the Sapienza - University of Rome.

The aims of the partnership starting from the STSM developed in Rome are to synthesis the observed data sampling at multi-taxonomic level of the European Temperate Forest ecosystems within the iLand model of forest dynamics and forest disturbances.

In the specific we want to create a work linkage between the approaches on the field and through modelling, and develop analysis of biodiversity trajectory in function of the time - management and ecosystem site. Moreover we want to classify forest structure predictors of biodiversity indicators at multi-taxonomic level and in a long run the relationship of biodiversity indicators with ecosystem functioning.
