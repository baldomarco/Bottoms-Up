# Plot_synthesis_automatised.r

THE SCRIPT WORKING AND MORE UPDATED IS THE Plot_synthesis_automatised.r.r BUT IT WORKS WITH THE HP zbook laptop.
THERE IS A PROBLEM OF R VERSIONS OR SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT NOT PERMITE ME TO USE THE R PACKAGE "rgdal" FOR THIS REASON IS WORKING IN THE OTHER COMPUTER INCLUDED THE DIRECTORY FOR PROCESS CORRECTLY THE DATA
IN THIS VERSION WE HAVE TWO PARTS OF THE ANALYSIS: 
1) ONE IS THE WHOLE BOTTOMS UP DATABASE CONVERSION OF THE PLOTS INTO EXCEL TABLES EVERY SINGLE PLOTS DIVIDED BY FOLDERS RAPPRESENTING THE DIFFERENT SITES/DATASET OF PLOTS. HERE THE MAIN CHANGE IS THE COORDINATES CONVERSION IN METRICS COORDINATES OF EVERY SINGLE TREE PRESENT AND DELETE OF NA VALUES.
2) PROCESS ONLY FOR THE CZECH REPUBLIC CZ1 SITE EVERYTHING NEEDED FOR THE INPUT TABLES IN ILAND (INIT, GIS, ENV TABLES, RU, ETC)


# Sampling_Plot_Synthesis.r

THIS SCRIPT IS WORKING BUT WITH MANY SECTION THAT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE FOR SEVERAL REASONS, NEEDS TO BE CLEAN. ALSO THE INPUT ILAND TABLES ARE MADE ONE BY ONE AFTER THE SAVING OF THE SEPARATED EXCEL TABLES.
STILL HERE DOESN'T WORK IN THE DELL PC. IT WAS USED TO PLOT THE COORDINATES CONVERSIONS AND COMPERISON AND EXPLORE THE METHODOLOGY OT ACHIVE THE INPUT TABLES NEEDED FOR ILAND IS AN OLD VERSION

# Sampling_Plot_Synthesis_loop_working_progress.r

AS FOR THE SAMPLING PLOT SYNTHESIS BUT TRYING TO MAKE A LOOP TO PROCESS ALL THE PLOTS TOGETHER INSTEAD THEN SEPARETLY LIKE IT IS NOW.
